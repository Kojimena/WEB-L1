318: Telnet Protocol, April 3, 1972.
  At the October 1971 Network Working Group Meeting, I promised to
   promptly produce a document which clearly and succinctly specified
   and explained the Official Telnet Protocol.  This document fails to
   meet any part of that promise.  This document was not produced
   promptly.  This document is neither clear nor succinct.  There is NO
   Official Telnet Protocol.

675: SPECIFICATION OF INTERNET TRANSMISSION CONTROL PROGRAM, December 1974.
    This document describes the functions to be performed by the
   internetwork Transmission Control Program [TCP] and its interface to
   programs or users that require its services. Several basic
   assumptions are made about process to process communication and these
   are listed here without further justification. The interested reader
   is referred to [CEKA74, TOML74, BELS74, DALA74, SUNS74] for further
   discussion.

819: The Domain Naming Convention for Internet User Applications, August 1982.
    For many years, the naming convention "<user>@<host>" has served the
   ARPANET user community for its mail system, and the substring
   "<host>" has been used for other applications such as file transfer
   (FTP) and terminal access (Telnet).  With the advent of network
   interconnection, this naming convention needs to be generalized to
   accommodate internetworking.  A decision has recently been reached to
   replace the simple name field, "<host>", by a composite name field,
   "<domain>" [2].  This note is an attempt to clarify this generalized
   naming convention, the Internet Naming Convention, and to explore the
   implications of its adoption for Internet name service and user
   applications.

1034:DOMAIN NAMES - CONCEPTS AND FACILITIES, November 1987.
    This RFC is an introduction to the Domain Name System (DNS), and omits
    many details which can be found in a companion RFC, "Domain Names -
    Implementation and Specification" [RFC-1035].  That RFC assumes that the
    reader is familiar with the concepts discussed in this memo.
